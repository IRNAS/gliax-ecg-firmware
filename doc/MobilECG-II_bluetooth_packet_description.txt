Most of the preparation and actual sending of packets is done in the file ECGSender.cpp in the function ECGSender::send()

Whole packet is sent over Bluetooth (we will send over some kind of USB interface) in following format:
1. Header (which consists of Packetizer::Header and ECGHeader)
2. ECG data which is held in compressBuffer
3. Checksum (16-bit) which is calculated over all data above (Header + compressBuffer)

Header cosists of following fields
Packetizer::Header            Value
  32 bit signature            0x41544144
  16 bit length               ADS1298::instance().getAvailableData() + sizeof(ECGHeader) - length of ECGHeader and Data
  8  bit version              0
  8  bit type                 0 (ECG type, which converts to 0)
  32 bit packetId             Starts from 0 and increased
  8  bit reserved             0 
  8  bit headerChecksum       Checksum is calculated live
See function Packetizer::startPacket()
ECGHeader
  8  bit channelCount         4 or 6 or 8
  32 bit sampleCount          depends on data in circular buffer
  32 bit numBits              Initially: 0, Later: Depends on number of bits in BitFifo, max 18008
  float  lsbInMv              Initially: 0.0001430511475/6*32, Later: 0.0001430511475/gain*32, where gain = [1,2,3,4,6,8,12]
  float  samplingFrequency    488.28125

ECG data
compressBuffer[2251] 8 bit unsigned data points

Checksum is calculated over whole data - Packetizer::Header + ECGHeader + ECG data

Sending Package Format:
ecgPredictor holds previous values of all ADC channels. Initally, all channels are 0.
All channels are read through ADS1298 module and then passed to compressor (DifferenceEcgCompressor).
In the compressor, predictor values are subtracted from current values of ECG data. If difference is bigger than 8 bits,
only difference comparing to previous value is sent. If difference is sent, it is preceded with bit value 0. In
case difference is bigger than 8 bits, then whole value is sent with maximum of 19 bits. In case when whole value is
sent, it is preceded with bit value 1. In this way, amount of traffic is reduced.
All the bits required to be sent are pushed to fifo which is sent over Bluetooth - ECG Data
